# 1 Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

From a user's perspective, device licenses are managed by the Bosch Rexroth Licensing Center [https://licensing.boschrexroth.com](https://licensing.boschrexroth.com). 

Using the portal it is possible to assign licenses to a device and to download a capability response, which contains all assigned licenses for a specific device. The downloaded capability response can than be deployed to the corresponding device.

The ctrlX CORE User Interfaces therefore provides a page which allows to upload a capability response and to check the currently available licenses on the device. For developers, the ctrlX CORE offers a restful API via an internal unix domain socket which can be used by an app to request and release a specific license.

# 2 License Enforcement <a name="enforcement"></a>

To integrate an app into the license management, please follow the instructions below.

## 2.1 Add Content Plug to snapcraft.yaml (<a name="plug"></a>)
To get access to the unix domain socket that provides the restful API, add the following content plug definition to the snapcraft.yaml:

```yaml
plugs:
  licensing-service:
    interface: content
    content: licensing-service
    target: $SNAP_DATA/licensing-service
``` 

This will create a folder "license-service" during installation of the app on the ctrlX CORE and provide access to the unix domain socket "licensing-service.sock" which will be located in the folder.

## 2.2 Adapt package-manifest.json <a name="manifest"></a>

The app shall provide information in the package-manifest about each license that is supported. Description and title shall be human readable.
The "required" flag indicates whether a license is mandatory to use the application. Set the flag to true when the license is required and to false, when the license is optional. 

  ```json
  "licenses": [
      {
        "name": "SWL-XCx-FRW-BASIC_FOOBAR-NNNN",
        "title": "ctrlX CORE - Foobar License",
        "description": "Unlock the App's functionality.",
        "required": true
      },
      {
        "name": "SWL-XCx-FRW-ADVANCED_FOOBAR",
        "title": "ctrlX CORE - Foobar License Extension",
        "description": "This license extends the functionality of the App.",
        "required": false
      }
    ],
  ```

## 2.3 Use REST API to enforce licenses <a name="rest"></a>


### 2.3.1 License Integration

How an app reacts when no license is present or the license is removed during runtime, can be freely chosen by the app. Nevertheless, to provide a unique user experience across multiple apps, the following best practices are recommended.

The app should acquire the license when started or (each time) when a function is called which requires a license. Additionally, the app should check whether the license is still present on the device in regular intervals or if the license has been removed or expired. Therefore, either release and re-acquire the license or use the getCapabilities() function. This applies for both, mandatory and optional, types of licenses.

In case a license is not required anymore - e.g. when the app is stopped or uninstalled - the license should be released so that it is returned to the license pool and can be acquired by another app. Otherwise, the license will become available again only after a reboot of the device.

In case a license is missing, a warning or an error shall be displayed and/or logged and the user should be informed which licences are required to execute the specific functionality of the app.

 
!!! important
    On the ctrlX CORE, when enforcing licenses the use of the license management is mandatory. Individual implementations are not permitted.


### 2.3.2 License Manager API

The licensing API is available on GitHub: [https://boschrexroth.github.io/rest-api-description](https://boschrexroth.github.io/rest-api-description)

Implementing this API, an app is able to
- Acquire a license
- Release a license
- Get a list of all available license capabilities
- Update the license status in a ctrlX CORE


| Function | HTTP Method | URI | Payload | Response |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Aquire license	| POST |/license| {<br>"name": "SWL-XCx-FRW-BASIC_FOOBAR-NNNN",<br>  "version": "1.0" <br>} | 200<br>{<br>  "isPermanent": true,<br>  "endDate": "2030-01-01T12:00:27.<br>7+00:20",<br>  "name": "SWL-XCx-FRW-BASIC_FOOBAR-NNNN",<br>  "id": <br>0083d875-30e8-4ff6-9f92-46096ef2d123",<br>  "version": "1.0",<br>  "startDate":"2030-01-01T12:00:27.87+00:20"<br>} |
|Release license|	DELETE|	/license/{id}	|none |	204	|
|Get list of all activated capabilities	|GET|	/capabilities	|none	|200,<br>[<br>{<br>"isPermanent": true,<br>    "finalExpirationDate": "2030-01-01T12:00:27.87+00:20",<br>    "name": "SWL-XCx-FRW-BASIC_FOOBAR-NNNN",<br>    "count": 1,<br>    "version": "1.0",<br>    "startDate": "2030-01-01T12:00:27.87+00:20"<br>  }<br>]<br>]
| Update the capability state in the device|	PUT|	/capabilities	|file<br>string($binary)



### 2.3.3 Acquiring & releasing a license

Acquiring a license generates a unique license ID for that particular license. 


> ![](images/licensing2.png)

This ID is required to release the license. Therefore, this ID should be stored in a directory which is not affected when your application goes into a faulty state and needs to be restarted. The usage of /tmp is recommended for this.

!!! hint
    Know more about mounting temporary disk in memory system type:tmpfs from snap documentation.


### 2.3.4 Available licenses on the device (activated capabilities)
Upon request, an app may retrieve the list of available licenses on the device including all details (e.g. expiration, counter, ...). This may be used to check whether a specific license is available (and not in use) before trying to acquire it.
Nevertheless, this is optional - it is sufficient to just try to acquire a license and then check whether the acquisition request was successful.

Sample response:

### 2.3.5 Update license status
The API allows to upload a capability response from the license portal to update the license status on the device (e.g. add new licenses). This functionality is not required by an app itself.

# 3 Licensing Modes  <a name="modes"></a>

## 3.1 Overview <a name="overview"></a>
The license management on the **ctrlX CORE** supports several different licensing modes. THe following table gives an overview about the license modes.

| License Mode | Target | Key | Usage | Additional information |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Main License | ctrlX CORE |`SWL_XCR_{YOUR_APP_LICENSE_CODE}` | mandatory |(none specific)
| Temporary Usage Rights (Emergency Mode) | ctrlX CORE |`SWL_XCR_{YOUR_APP_LICENSE_CODE}` | mandatory |`tampered` flag is `true` |
| 10 Day Trial License |ctrlX CORE |`SWL_XCR_{YOUR_APP_LICENSE_CODE}` | optional |`isPermanent` flag is `false`
|Four Hour Engineering Demo License |ctrlX CORE<sup>virtual</sup>|`SWL_XCR_ENGINEERING_4H`|optional|(none specific)

As displayed in the table, there is only the "four hour engineering demo license" available on the **ctrlX CORE<sup>virtual</sup>**, which allows to evaluate a new app for a limited time (the trlX CORE<sup>virtual</sup> is terminated after four hours to prevent productive use)

The different license modes, and the expected behaviour of the App for these modes, are briefly described below.

## 3.2 ctrlX CORE Main License  <a name="main"></a>

**Purpose:** Standard License

**Description:**

- This is the standard license that a user obtains when buying an app. Therefore, the support of this license mode is **mandatory**.
- The license is obtained (bought) in the Bosch Rexroth Licensing Center and then assigned to a specific device by the user.
- The standard license can be either permanent (unlimited) or time based (expires)

**Expected App Behaviour**:

- The app shall start and run as intended, when the standard license is available.
- If acquiring a license is not possible (no license is available), the app shall inform the user that a license needs to be obtained.
- In case of time based licenses, the app should inform the user on time before the license expires. As a best practice, a user should be informed 
four weeks prior to expiration.
- When no standard app specific license is available on the device, an app shall only run if one of the other licenses is active.


## 3.3 ctrlX CORE Temporary Usage Rights (Emergency Mode)  <a name="emergency"></a>

**Purpose:** Avoid machine downtime

**Description:**

- On a ctrlX CORE, the user  has the possibility to activate a special mode that is called "Temporary usage rights". The mode can be activated using the License Manager UI.
- Enabling this mode allows users to operate the ctrlX CORE in a productive environment for ten consecutive days. The single purpose of this mode is to prevent a downtime when a defect device is replaced and no licenses have been assigned, yet. ==**This mode can only be activated once on a device**==
- Within these ten days, the user has to either add licenses to the new device or move the licenses from the broken device to the replacement device.

!!! warning
    After ten days, the mode will expire and cannot be reactivated.

**Expected App Behaviour:**

 - Support of this license is **mandatory**.
 - The app is able to detect whether the system runs in this mode by evaluating the `tampered` flag in the response to the acquisition request (the flag is set to `true`)
 - When this mode is active, the app should work as if a standard license is available.

## 3.4 ctrX CORE 10 Day Trial License  <a name="trial"></a>

**Purpose:** Test Mode on ctrlX CORE Hardware

**Description:**

- The 10 day trial license allows to use all apps - which support this license mode - for a restricted time for testing purposes.
- The license is intended for test and evaluation only and not for use in a production environment
- The license will automatically expire after 10 days.
- Other than the temporary usage rights mode, 10 day trial licenses may be used (consecutively) in case an according contractual agreement is available for all involved parties (Bosch Rexroth, Customer, ctrlX World Partner).

**Expected App Behaviour:**
- Support of this mode is **optional**.
- The app is able to detect whether the system runs in this mode by evaluating the `isPermanent` flag in the response to the acquisition request (the flag is set to `false`)
 - When this mode is active, the app should work as if a standard license is available.


## 3.5 Four Hour Engineering Demo License on  ctrlX CORE<sup>virtual</sup> <a name="virtual"></a>

**Purpose**: Evaluation mode on a ctrlX CORE<sup>virtual</sup>
**Description**:
-  An according special license key (`SWL_XCR_ENGINEERING_4H`) indicates that currently the limited evaluation mode is active
- After 4 hours the ctrlX CORE<sup>virtual</sup> shuts down itself to prevent a productive use.

**Expected App Behaviour:**
- Support of this mode is **optional**.
- In order to support this non-productive mode, apps must check for the license `SWL_XCR_ENGINEERING_4H`, which guarantees that the runtime is limited to 4 hours.

##  3.6 Additional License Mode: ctrX CORE 3 Month Test License  <a name="test"></a>
**Purpose:** Time limited test and evaluation of apps which are in beta/prototype phase (B-Sample phase)

**Description:**

- This mode is not intended / available for partner apps by default.
- Please get in touch with Bosch Rexroth directly, if this mode might be of interest for you.
